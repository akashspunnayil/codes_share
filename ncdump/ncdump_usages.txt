To look at just the header information (also called the schema or metadata):

$ ncdump -h mslp.nc



To look at header and coordinate information, but not the data:

$ ncdump -c mslp.nc



To look at all the data in the file, in addition to the metadata:

$ ncdump mslp.nc



To look at a subset of the data by specifying one or more variables:

$ ncdump -v lat,time mslp.nc



To see times in human-readable form:

$ ncdump -t -v lat,time mslp.nc



To look at what kind of netCDF data is in the file (classic, 64-bit offset, netCDF-4, or netCDF-4 classic model):

$ ncdump -k mslp.nc
